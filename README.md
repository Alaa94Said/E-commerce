# 🧪 Cypress E-Commerce Automation Framework
Cypress E2E Automation Framework for E-commerce Application
Description

This project is a robust end-to-end (E2E) test automation framework built using Cypress, designed to validate the complete shopping flow of an e-commerce website — from registration and login to product checkout.
The framework adopts the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for better scalability, readability, and maintainability, ensuring test cases remain clean and reusable across multiple features.

## Overview

This project automates key user journeys on [AutomationExercise](https://automationexercise.com) using **Cypress** with a **Page Object Model (POM)** structure.  
It simulates real-world e-commerce user flows including:

- ✅ User registration and login  
- 🛍️ Adding products to the cart  
- 🧾 Checkout and order placement  
- 💬 Adding product reviews  

The framework is integrated with **Allure Reports** and can run in **GitHub Actions** or **Azure DevOps** pipelines.

:file_folder: Repository Structure

This repository includes the following main components:

cypress/e2e: Contains test scenarios for complete purchase and checkout flows.

cypress/support/pages: Includes Page Object files for modular and reusable UI interactions.

cypress.config.js: Main configuration file for Cypress setup and Allure reporting integration.

screenshots/: Stores screenshots for failed test runs (auto-generated by Cypress).

allure-results/: Contains raw Allure report data after test execution.

:boom: What is it all about?

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a fully automated E2E test suite for an e-commerce platform using Cypress.
It simulates real-world user interactions such as account creation, login, adding products to the cart, submitting reviews, and completing the checkout process — all validated through assertions and integrated with Allure Reports for detailed visual analytics.

:golf: Why was this project created?

E-commerce systems involve complex user journeys that require reliable validation. This framework was created to:

Automate regression scenarios in the shopping flow.

Ensure consistent and accurate test execution through Cypress automation.

Provide clear, detailed reporting using Allure.

Support easy CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipelines.
:bulb: Features and Functionalities

Full Purchase Flow Automation – From registration to checkout completion.

Page Object Model (POM) – Modular and reusable page definitions.

Dynamic Data Generation – Unique user emails for each registration.

Allure Reporting – Detailed test steps, screenshots, and execution metrics.

CI/CD Ready – Easily integrated with GitHub Actions or Azure pipelines.

Assertions – Comprehensive validation using Cypress .should() assertions.

Reusable Custom Commands – Simplifies repeated flows like cy.loginViaUI().
:writing_hand: Key Test Scenarios
